Designed with FP in mind
Immutable views/components
Pure render function
One way data flow
Not tied to DOM
Write once, run anywhere vs Learn once, write anywhere
Why not MVC? (View/Service/Store)
JSX
Difference between properties and state

Composition

Stateless components (State.js)
References (CreateTodoForm.js)
Restricting renders (TodoList.js)

Testing components

React chrome tool
